# Software Renderer from Scratch
This project/assignment was to implement the real-time graphics pipeline using C++ from scratch. OpenGL was used only as a way to display the framebuffer onto the screen. 

## Graphics Pipeline
The following features were implemented:
- Vertex Processing/Transformation
- Clipping
- Perspective-correct interpolation
- Rasterization - Two Methods
  - Simple Bounding-Box Rasterization
  - Scanline Rasterization (actual method used since it's faster)
- Texture Mapping
- Z-Buffer/Depth Sorting
- Framebuffer operations
